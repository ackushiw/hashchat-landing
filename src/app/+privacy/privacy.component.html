	    <h4>1. Information we collect</h4>

	    <p>The Lowdown</p>

	    <p>Sure, we collect different types of information, but try to respect your privacy as much as possible in doing so.</p>

	    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

	    <p>Information you provide us directly:</p>

	    <ul>
	        <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile.</li>

	        <li>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>

	    </ul>

	    <p>Analytics information:</p>

	    <ul>
	        <li>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>Cookies and similar technologies:</p>

	    <ul>
	        <li>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use HashChat and provide features to you.</li>
